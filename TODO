option to make payments

Generate receiving challan same as invoice on inward order

new field in payment -> accepted by - automatic by current user -> Used author for this

static indexing while saving outward orders is buggy as out of 3 olis if first is out of stock,
still out entry is made for it. Static indexing from request.

Code refactor for naming convention

Base abstract model for audit fields (using django-author and django-extensions for this)

Custom user model

Invoice should contain name of the receiver

selected section to be auto expanded and highlighted in side bar

Rate column to include rupee symbol

Chember number to be taken as input along with inward order details

User authentication for each operation
