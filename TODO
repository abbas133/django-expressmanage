static indexing while saving outward orders is buggy as out of 3 olis if first is out of stock,
still out entry is made for it. Static indexing from request.

Code refactor for naming convention

Base abstract model for audit fields

Custom user model = DONE

new field in payment -> accepted by - automatic by current user

Generate receiving challan same as invoice on outward order

Invoice should contain name of the receiver

selected section to be auto expanded and highlighted in side bar

Facebook like timeline in customer detail page which will show inward order, outward orders and payment
